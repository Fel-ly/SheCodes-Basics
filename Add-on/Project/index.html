    <p>
      Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and
      resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and
      better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings
      and cliffhangers are used extensively. Thrillers often overlap with
      mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In
      a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than
      uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much
      grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass
      murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments.
      Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a
      mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the
      hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives
      of others
